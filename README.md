# CodeCuisine Restaurant Menu System

Welcome to the CodeCuisine Restaurant Menu System! This project provides a simple web-based menu system for a restaurant where users can view the menu items and place orders.

## Features

- Menu Display: Users can view menu items categorized into starters, main courses, and desserts.
- Order Placement: Users can click on menu items to add them to their order list.
- Total Calculation: The system calculates the total price of the order based on the items selected.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the webpage.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the webpage.

- Visual Studio Code: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing and managing the code.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes to the codebase.

## Getting Started

To use the CodeCuisine Menu System, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The menu will be displayed, and you can start adding items to your order by clicking on them.

## Customization

- Menu Items: You can customize the menu items by modifying the menu object in the JavaScript file (index.js).
- Item Prices: The system assumes each item costs R38. You can customize item prices by updating the itemPrice variable in the addToOrder() function in index.js.
